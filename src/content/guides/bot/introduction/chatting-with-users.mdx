# Chatting with Users

Not all conversations are meant to be public. You can create a chat conversation to interact with users in private.

*Note: Your bot should never interact with users without obtaining their consent. Be extra careful to avoid potentially spammy behaviour in private conversations!*

## Accepting Messages

By default, your bot account will only receive messages from users it follows. To receive messages from any (or no) user, you can use the <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/Bot#setChatPreference" type="Method" /> method.

Valid options for this method are:

- <Reference to="/docs/bot/enums/IncomingChatPreference#None" type="EnumMember">IncomingChatPreference.None</Reference> - Your bot will not receive any new messages. Existing conversations will be unaffected.
- <Reference to="/docs/bot/enums/IncomingChatPreference#Following" type="EnumMember">IncomingChatPreference.Following</Reference> - Your bot will only receive messages from users it follows. This is the default setting.
- <Reference to="/docs/bot/enums/IncomingChatPreference#All" type="EnumMember">IncomingChatPreference.All</Reference> - Your bot will receive messages from any user.

```ts twoslash
import { Bot, IncomingChatPreference } from "@skyware/bot";
// ---cut---
const bot = new Bot();
await bot.setChatPreference(IncomingChatPreference.All);
```

This only needs to be set once for your bot account. You can change it at any time.

## Starting a Conversation

To chat with a user, you need a <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/Conversation" /> object.

If you know the DID(s) of the user(s) you want to chat with, you can use the <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/Bot#getConversationForMembers" type="Method" /> method.

```ts twoslash
import { Bot } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const bot: Bot;
// ---cut---
const conversation = await bot.getConversationForMembers(["did:plc:ith6w2xyj2qy3rcvmlsem6fz"]);
```

This method will fetch an existing conversation if one exists, or create a new one if it doesn't.

You can obtain a list of all conversations the bot is a part of by calling the <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/Bot#listConversations" type="Method" /> method.

```ts twoslash
import { Bot } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const bot: Bot;
// ---cut---
const { cursor, conversations } = await bot.listConversations();

// The method only returns 100 conversations at a time — use the cursor to fetch more conversations
const { conversations: moreConversations } = await bot.listConversations({ cursor });
```

## Sending and Reading Messages

Start by obtaining the <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/Conversation" /> object for the user you want to chat with. You can then send messages to the user and read their responses.

```ts twoslash
import { Bot } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const bot: Bot;
// ---cut---
const conversation = await bot.getConversationForMembers(["skyware.js.org"]);
```

You can read chat history by calling the <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/Conversation#getMessages" type="Method" /> method. This will return an array of <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/ChatMessage" /> and <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/DeletedChatMessage" /> objects.

```ts twoslash
import { Conversation } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const conversation: Conversation;
// ---cut---
const { cursor, messages } = await conversation.getMessages();

// You'll only receive up to 100 messages at a time — you can use the cursor to fetch messages further into the past!
const { messages: moreMessages } = await conversation.getMessages(cursor);
```

You can send messages to the user by calling the <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/Conversation#sendMessage" type="Method" /> method.

```ts twoslash
import { Conversation } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const conversation: Conversation;
// ---cut---
await conversation.sendMessage({ text: "Hello, world!" });
```

Like posts, you can use a <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/RichText" /> instance to send rich text messages containing links and mentions. More on that in [Rich Text](/docs/bot/guides/advanced-posting/rich-text).

```ts twoslash
import { Conversation } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const conversation: Conversation;
// ---cut---
import { RichText } from "@skyware/bot";
await conversation.sendMessage({
    text: new RichText().addText("I love ").addLink("Skyware", "https://skyware.js.org").addText("!")
});
```

If you already have a <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/Profile" /> object, you can skip the <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/Conversation" /> and send and read messages directly.

```ts twoslash
import { Profile } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const profile: Profile;
// ---cut---
await profile.sendMessage({ text: "Hello, world!" });
const { messages } = await profile.getMessages();
```

## Receiving Message Events

Of course, you won't usually know in advance who you want to message. You may want your bot to respond to private messages from any user.

To start, you'll want to initialize your bot with <Reference to="/docs/bot/types/BotOptions#emitChatEvents" type="Property">emitChatEvents</Reference> set to `true`.

```ts twoslash
import { Bot } from "@skyware/bot";
// ---cut---
const bot = new Bot({ emitChatEvents: true });
```

Your bot will now emit an event whenever a message is received, which you can handle as follows:

```ts twoslash
import { Bot, type ChatMessage } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const bot: Bot;
// ---cut---
bot.on("message", async (message: ChatMessage) => {
	console.log(`Received message: ${message.text}`);
});
```

You can access a reference to the sender's profile and the conversation the message was sent in by calling the <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/ChatMessage#getSender"  type="Method">getSender</Reference> and <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/ChatMessage#getConversation"  type="Method">getConversation</Reference> methods.

```ts twoslash
import { Bot, type ChatMessage } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const bot: Bot;
// ---cut---
bot.on("message", async (message: ChatMessage) => {
    const sender = await message.getSender();
	console.log(`Received message from @${sender.handle}: ${message.text}`);

    const conversation = await message.getConversation();
    if (conversation) {
		// It may not always be possible to resolve the conversation the message was sent in!
		await conversation.sendMessage({ text: "Hey there, " + sender.displayName + "!" });
	}
});
```

## With Great Power...

...comes great responsibility. People don't like unsolicited messages. It's your responsibility to ensure your bot is well-behaved and makes Bluesky a better place for everyone.
