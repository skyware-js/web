# Rich Text

By default, when you create a post, `@skyware/bot` parses your post's text to identify any mentions, hashtags, and URLs. However, in some cases, you may want more control over how a post is displayed. The <Reference to="https://github.com/mary-ext/atcute/tree/trunk/packages/bluesky/richtext-builder">RichText</Reference> class provides a convenient interface for constructing a post containing rich text.

## Usage

To start, import the `RichText` class from `@skyware/bot`:

```ts twoslash
import { RichText } from "@skyware/bot";
```

You can then build a rich text string as follows:

```ts twoslash
import { RichText, Bot } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const bot: Bot;
// ---cut---
const richText = new RichText()
    .addText("Hey, check out this library: ")
    .addLink("skyware.js.org", "https://skyware.js.org")
    .addText("! ")
    .addTag("#atdev");

await bot.post({ text: richText })
```

You'll notice that the `Bot#post` method can accept either `RichText` or a string. Your post will look something like:

![A post by user @skyware.js.org with the text "Hey, check out this library: skyware.js.org! #atdev". The link and the hashtag are highlighted blue.](/img/rich-text/rt-basic.png)

## Mentions

When you're manually constructing `RichText`, mentioning a user requires you to know the user's handle and DID. You can then use the `.addMention` method to add a mention to your post:

```ts twoslash
import { RichText, Bot } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const bot: Bot;
// ---cut---
const richText = new RichText()
    .addText("Hey, ")
    .addMention("@skyware.js.org", "did:plc:ith6w2xyj2qy3rcvmlsem6fz")
    .addText("!");

await bot.post({ text: richText })
```

Note that the DID provided *could* differ from the mentioned handle — a mention is really just a hyperlink! Use this power for good.

## Hyperlinks

Speaking of hyperlinks, mentions aren't the only way to have text act as a link. The `.addLink` method we previously used can also take two parameters: text and a URL.

```ts twoslash
import { RichText, Bot } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const bot: Bot;
// ---cut---
const richText = new RichText()
    .addText("Hey, check out ")
    .addLink("Skyware", "https://skyware.js.org")
    .addText("!");

await bot.post({ text: richText })
```

![A post by user @skyware.js.org with the text "Hey, check out Skyware!". The word "Skyware" is highlighted blue.](/img/rich-text/rt-hyperlink.png)

## Plain text

As mentioned before, in most cases you won't need to use the `RichText` builder, as methods like `post` and `reply` will automatically parse your text. However, if you do want to provide facets manually — say, copied from another post — you can provide the `facets` option:

```ts twoslash
import { Post, Bot } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const bot: Bot;
declare const otherPost: Post;
// ---cut---
await bot.post({ text: otherPost.text, facets: otherPost.facets });
```

Or to include no facets, pass `resolveFacets: false` to disable the automatic detection:

```ts twoslash
declare const bot: import("@skyware/bot").Bot;
// ---cut---
await bot.post({
	text: "i love the @protocol"
}, { resolveFacets: false });
```

## Moving on

You may notice that adding a link to a post doesn't automatically add an embedded preview. Learn more about that in [Embeds and Images](/guides/bot/advanced-posting/embeds-and-images)!
